#### Explore distribution of daily burned areas, test power law fits and changes over time #### 
# Andrew Latimer 
# Q: are there more "extreme spread events" EWEs recently? If so, are those simply the result of drawing more fire days from the same distribution, or is there a distribution shift that favors higher extremes? If so is there any clue why that's happening? 

# Input to this script is the file of daily burned areas output from "extract_daily_area.R" in this repository
